The data generation code is exported to datagen.jar. 
The data generation program can be run using the following steps:

1. In command line run the datagen.jar using the following command:
	java -jar datagen.jar -inputJson <d-json> -output <d-out> -threads 1

Here, <d-json> is the directory that contains all the JSON files and 
<d-out> is the directory where the generated dataset will be stored.

For collecting the JSON files follow the procedure:

1. Go to github.com and search the project for which you want to create the dataset. 
For example, if you want to create dataset for Apache Mavan project, 
go to https://github.com/apache/maven.

2. Invoke a GitHub http-based RESTful API to get the metadata of the project by 
constructing a URL https://api.github.com/repos/repo_full_name, 
for example https://api.github.com/repos/apache/maven. 

3. Copy the whole JSON object, create a blank file, type a pair of brackets 
‘[]’ (for JSON array), paste the copied JSON object inside the brackets, save the file as filename.json.

4. In similar way, another JSON object can be collected and pasted in the same file/or different file.
 
5. Multiple files can be created. 
One file contains one JSON array which in turn contains multiple JSON objects. 
Each JSNO object is for one Github project.
